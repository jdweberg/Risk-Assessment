<h1>DATACOM Job Simulation - Risk Assessment</h1>


<h2>Description</h2>
In this job simulation by DATACOM, the task was to complete a risk assessment for a client to "help them define the context, assess their risk matrix, and identify potential risk scenarios." I was tasked with defining three risk scenarios, assessing the current and post-improvement risk levels for each, and creating a risk assessment report for the client.
